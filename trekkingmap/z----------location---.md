About 
RxDart extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and StreamControllers.

Dart comes with a very decent Streams API out-of-the-box; rather than attempting to provide an alternative to this API, RxDart adds functionality from the reactive extensions specification on top of it.

RxDart does not provide its Observable class as a replacement for Dart Streams. Instead, it offers several additional Stream classes, operators (extension methods on the Stream class), and Subjects.

If you are familiar with Observables from other languages, please see the Rx Observables vs. Dart Streams comparison chart for notable distinctions between the two.

Upgrading from RxDart 0.22.x to 0.23.x 
RxDart 0.23.x moves away from the Observable class, utilizing Dart 2.6's new extension methods instead. This requires several small refactors that can be easily automated -- which is just what we've done!

Please follow the instructions on the rxdart_codemod package to automatically upgrade your code to support RxDart 0.23.x.

How To Use RxDart 
For Example: Reading the Konami Code 
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  const konamiKeyCodes = <int>[
    KeyCode.UP,
    KeyCode.UP,
    KeyCode.DOWN,
    KeyCode.DOWN,
    KeyCode.LEFT,
    KeyCode.RIGHT,
    KeyCode.LEFT,
    KeyCode.RIGHT,
    KeyCode.B,
    KeyCode.A,
  ];

  final result = querySelector('#result')!;

  document.onKeyUp
      .map((event) => event.keyCode)
      .bufferCount(10, 1) // An extension method provided by rxdart
      .where((lastTenKeyCodes) => const IterableEquality<int>().equals(lastTenKeyCodes, konamiKeyCodes))
      .listen((_) => result.innerHtml = 'KONAMI!');
}
API Overview 
RxDart adds functionality to Dart Streams in three ways:

Stream Classes - create Streams with specific capabilities, such as combining or merging many Streams.
Extension Methods - transform a source Stream into a new Stream with different capabilities, such as throttling or buffering events.
Subjects - StreamControllers with additional powers
Stream Classes 
The Stream class provides different ways to create a Stream: Stream.fromIterable or Stream.periodic. RxDart provides additional Stream classes for a variety of tasks, such as combining or merging Streams!

You can construct the Streams provided by RxDart in two ways. The following examples are equivalent in terms of functionality:

Instantiating the Stream class directly.
Example: final mergedStream = MergeStream([myFirstStream, mySecondStream]);
Using static factories from the Rx class, which are useful for discovering which types of Streams are provided by RxDart. Under the hood, these factories call the corresponding Stream constructor.
Example: final mergedStream = Rx.merge([myFirstStream, mySecondStream]);
List of Classes / Static Factories
CombineLatestStream (combine2, combine3... combine9) / Rx.combineLatest2...Rx.combineLatest9
ConcatStream / Rx.concat
ConcatEagerStream / Rx.concatEager
DeferStream / Rx.defer
ForkJoinStream (join2, join3... join9) / Rx.forkJoin2...Rx.forkJoin9
FromCallableStream / Rx.fromCallable
MergeStream / Rx.merge
NeverStream / Rx.never
RaceStream / Rx.race
RangeStream / Rx.range
RepeatStream / Rx.repeat
RetryStream / Rx.retry
RetryWhenStream / Rx.retryWhen
SequenceEqualStream / Rx.sequenceEqual
SwitchLatestStream / Rx.switchLatest
TimerStream / Rx.timer
UsingStream / Rx.using
ZipStream (zip2, zip3, zip4, ..., zip9) / Rx.zip...Rx.zip9
If you're looking for an Interval equivalent, check out Dart's Stream.periodic for similar behavior.
Extension Methods 
The extension methods provided by RxDart can be used on any Stream. They convert a source Stream into a new Stream with additional capabilities, such as buffering or throttling events.

Example
Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3])
  .throttleTime(Duration(seconds: 1))
  .listen(print); // prints 1

Subjects 
Dart provides the StreamController class to create and manage a Stream. RxDart offers two additional StreamControllers with additional capabilities, known as Subjects:

BehaviorSubject - A broadcast StreamController that caches the latest added value or error. When a new listener subscribes to the Stream, the latest value or error will be emitted to the listener. Furthermore, you can synchronously read the last emitted value.
ReplaySubject - A broadcast StreamController that caches the added values. When a new listener subscribes to the Stream, the cached values will be emitted to the listener.
Rx Observables vs Dart Streams 
In many situations, Streams and Observables work the same way. However, if you're used to standard Rx Observables, some features of the Stream API may surprise you. We've included a table below to help folks understand the differences.

Additional information about the following situations can be found by reading the Rx class documentation.

Situation	Rx Observables	Dart Streams
An error is raised	Observable Terminates with Error	Error is emitted and Stream continues
Cold Observables	Multiple subscribers can listen to the same cold Observable, and each subscription will receive a unique Stream of data	Single subscriber only
Hot Observables	Yes	Yes, known as Broadcast Streams
Is {Publish, Behavior, Replay}Subject hot?	Yes	Yes
Single/Maybe/Completable ?	Yes	Yes, uses rxdart_ext Single (Completable = Single<void>, Maybe<T> = Single<T?>)
Support back pressure	Yes	Yes
Can emit null?	Yes, except RxJava	Yes
Sync by default	Yes	No
Can pause/resume a subscription*?	No	Yes
